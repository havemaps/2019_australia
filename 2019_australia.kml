The balcony was definitely a highlight, and my room was just high enough for a slight sea view. Unfortunately, it was too cold to really enjoy the outdoor space.</description>

I was preoccupied with the free-flowing sparkling wine and did not explore too much, but it seemed like the museum had a lot of exhibits dedicated to transportation. They even had a Mars Exhibit that reminded me of my days working at Space Camp. <br><img src="https://github.com/havemaps/2019_australia/blob/master/images/powerhouse.JPG?raw=true" alt="Image of a ceiling with many aircraft hanging down from historic to satellites">]]></description>
